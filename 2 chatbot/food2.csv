The Neer Dosa is made very similar to the Rava Dosa.To make the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa, we don’t spread it on the pan like a pancake or a regular dosa.
We pour the dosa batter on the hot pan and it will spread itself creating holes.Note: It is a good idea to use an iron pan, as the texture and the softness of the dosa comes out perfectly with an iron pan.To begin, make sure you have a greased and seasoned iron pan.
Grease and preheat the iron pan until it is sizzling hot.
When you sprinkle water on the pan; the water will sizzle and evaporate.Once you have the right heat on the pan; pour a ladle of the batter in a circular motion starting from the outer edges.
The batter will sizzle and flow to spread itself.
Fill in the batter where there are gap, but do allow the dosa to have a few tiny holes.
There is no need to sprinkle oil to cook the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa.The Neer Dosa cooks very quickly; when you notice the top of the dosa is no longer raw, the Neer Dosa is cooked.
The cooking process will take less than 30 seconds per dosa.Slide a flat spatula from the sides of the pan and fold the Neer Dosa into a half and then into another half to form a triangle.
Place the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa on a platter and continue to make Neer Dosa’s the similar way.Make sure you place the Hibiscus Neer Dosa away from each other when they are hot; as they tend to stick to each other.

Also, keep the stems, and don't remove them.
Slitting of the chillies helps the chillies to absorb curd/ yogurt easily.
In a large mixing bowl, add the curd, water and salt.
Whisk well and add the chillies.
Stir well with a clean ladle and avoid using your hands.
We need to now marinate the chillies in a bottle.Place the Mor Milagai, along with the curd mixture into a clean bottle.
Cover the bottle and keep aside in the kitchen counter.
The next morning shake the bottle well, to allow the marination to blend well into the chillies.
 Ensure there is no fungus around the chilles.Remove the chillies from the yogurt mixture and place it on a clean tray and place it under the sun for the entire day.
Keep the buttermilk in the bottle, as we be adding the chillies back into the same buttermilk at the end of the day.
Do not refrigerate this mixture.Loosely cover the Mor Milagai with a loose kitchen towel.
This is simply to preven the dust from sticking to the Mor Milagai.At the end of the day, place the chillies back into the bottle which had the buttermilk.
Shake well, so the chillies get well coated with the buttermilk mixture.
Allow it to marinate it the entire night.The next morning, shake the bottle and remove the chillies from the buttermilk mixture and dry it again under the sun for the entire day.Continue this process of drying and marination in the buttermilk for 4 days.
The buttermilk, will be mostly absorbed by the chillies.
The drying of the chillies, helps the chillies to absorb more buttermilk every day.At the end of 4 days you will have very little yogurt mixture and will be a thick paste.Mix the mor milagai chillies into the paste and ensure the chillies are well coated with the remaining yogurt paste.Spread this Mor Milagai in a tray and keep it under the sun to dry.
 Repeat the same process the next day, by tossing any remaining buttermilk/ yogurt paste and smearing it over the chillies.Dry it under the sun until  the chillies are completely dry and dehydrated.
Once the Mor Milagai is dry and feels de-hydrated and there is no moisture left, you can store it in a ziplock and freeze it and use it as and when required.How To Make & Serve the Mor Milagai Heat 1/4 cup of oil in a fry pan over medium heat.

The level of water is an inch above the red rice in the bowl.
Let it soak for about 6 hours.Soak the urad dal and fenugreek in water such that all of the dal is completely immersed in water.
The level of water will be 2 inches above the dal in the bowl.
Let it soak for about 6 hours.First grind the urad dal into a fine smooth batter.
While grinding just enough water to make it into a very very smooth batter.
The batter will look fluffy.Grind the red rice into a smooth batter, adding just the required amount of water to grind into a almost smooth batter.
Adding too much water will make the mixture too watery.
If required grind a little at a time to get a almost smooth batter .The red rice batter is a just slightly coarser, but the urad dal batter is super smooth.Combine the urad and red rice batter, add salt to taste and set aside for at least 12 hours or overnight until the batter ferments.
You will notice the batter would have risen in volume.Hence you should place the batter in a large container so it has enough room to increase in its volume.Note on fermenting the Red Rice Idli & Dosa BatterFermentation has to take place where the weather is warm.
So ideally in summer, the batter ferments very well and doubles or triples its quantity.
But in cold places, the batter has to be kept in an oven.
If your oven has light, then turn on the light for a few hours with the batter in the oven.
Once the oven is warm, turn off the light and let the batter ferment.
If your oven does not have a light, then preheat the oven to warm, turn off oven then keep the batter in the oven to ferment.This process can be mastered with experience.Method For making Dosa'sThe freshly fermented batter is great for making idlis.
So typically and traditionally, the first day after the rise, we made idlis at home and there after it is great for making dosas as well.For making ragi idlis do not dilute the batter with water.When making Red Rice dosas you can optionally dilute the batter with a little water to help in easy spreading.Preheat the skillet on medium heat and grease it.
Pour a ladleful of batter on the preheated tawa and spread the batter in circular motion to make a thin dosa.
Drizzle ghee or oil around the dosa and allow it to crisp.
Once done, flip the dosa and cook on the other side for a few seconds and serve.Proceed the same way to make the Red Rice Dosa with the remaining batter.Serve the Red Rice Dosa along with a bowl of Drumstick Sambar and Tomato Onion Chutney along with a glass of vegetable juice like Beetroot and Celery Juice for breakfast.

Add  water a little at a time to knead to make a soft dough.
Adding enough water is critical, so the dough is soft and pliable.
Add ghee and knead again.
Knead the dough well  to form a smooth dough.
Once done make a smooth ball of the dough, cover the bowl and keep aside for 2 hours.In the meanwhile, prepare the sweet coconut filling.
To do this, first heat a pan and add 1 teaspoon ghee.
Next add the grated coconut, cardamom powder and palm jaggery to it.Stir well on a low flame for 5-8 mins till all the moisture is absorbed and the coconut mix comes together with the jaggery.
Once the poli filling mixture has come together, turn off the heat and allow the mixture to cool.When it has cooled, divide it into equal sized portions and form balls the size of medium lemons.Now, take the dough that’s been resting and divide it into equal sized portions.Keeping a little flour for dusting handy on a plate; roll out the dough into 3 inch diameter circles.
Place a portion of the filling (puran) mixture into the center of the circle.
Bring edges of the circle towards the center and fold over to cover the entire filling; making sure the edges are all sealed well by pinching them together if there is any opening.Flatten the stuffed poli; dust the dough in a little flour and roll gently into a 5 to 6 inch diameter circle taking care not to put too much pressure as the filling can come out of the dough.
The Thengai Poli should be thin and not thick.
Once done, we will proceed to cook the poli.Preheat an iron skillet on medium high; place the rolled poli’s onto the skillet to cook until golden brown on both sides.
You can cook the poli's with ghee to give it a richer taste and flavor.Repeat the above process for all the remaining dough and puran portions and serve hot.You may store the Thengai Poli in an airtight container, in the refrigerator, once they have cooled.
